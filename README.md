# Advent of Code 2021

## Premise

Run advent of code solutions in hyperapp, with no build steps.
Most dependencies are installed simply to facilitate tests.
Theoretically, just run any static web server from the root, and this will work.

## How to do stuff

To run the server (just a static server, servor, thanks Luke J).

```bash
npm ci && npm start
```

To run the (very scant) tests:


```bash
npm test
```
